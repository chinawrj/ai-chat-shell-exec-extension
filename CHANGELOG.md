# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Nothing yet.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-19

- Defines the release around tmux-backed execution, diagnostics, portable calibration, and zero-knowledge hardening.
- Adds popup export/import for settings and per-origin calibration bindings.
- Routes shell-call execution through explicit tmux pane targets instead of spawning a new server-side shell.
- Lists tmux panes in the popup and in missing-target shell-output replies.
- Resolves the user tmux socket from LaunchAgent environments so background server calls can see interactive tmux panes.
- Adds a local HTTPS manual test page for exercising tmux-backed shell-call flows.
- Adds a helper to launch an isolated Chromium-family profile with the unpacked extension loaded for local testing.
- Adds an install doctor script for Node.js, manifest ID, shell server health, and origin-policy checks.
- Shows extension/server origin mismatches in popup and floating health checks.
- Keeps the root and `extension/` manifests aligned so either unpacked load path has the same version and permissions.
- Makes the local WebSocket server tolerate TCP-fragmented and coalesced text frames.
- Adds WebSocket frame parser coverage for partial, multiple, extended-length, masked, and server frames.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-16

- Adds AI instruction templates for ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot-style agents, and one-off prompts.
- Documents safe shell-call behavior, chaining rules, and the expected `shell-output` feedback loop.
- Updates README install flow to point users at the instruction templates before using the test button.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-16

Initial public release.

- Runs explicit `shell-call` blocks from AI chat pages through a local WebSocket shell server.
- Posts command results back as `shell-output` blocks.
- Uses zero-knowledge page adaptation based on editable elements, generic submit behavior, and optional user-bound controls.
- Includes a movable floating panel with `Test`, `Check`, and per-origin binding controls.
- Adds duplicate-execution protection in both the extension background worker and local server ledger.
- Adds a macOS LaunchAgent installer for keeping the local shell server running after login.
- Supports release packaging with SHA256 checksums.
